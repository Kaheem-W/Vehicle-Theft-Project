# Vehicle-Theft-Project
This repository contains the csv file of vehicle thefts reported by state in 2015 provided by Joe Boutros on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/2015-vehicle-thefts-by-state-and-make-model

The only changes made to the original file was the addition of another column with the "Make" of the vehicle separated from the "Make/Model" column for the use of analysis with Tableau.
